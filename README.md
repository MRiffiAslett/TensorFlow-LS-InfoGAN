# LS-GAN-TF

This repository contains some experiments of mine with Least Squares Generative Adversarial Networks (LS-GAN) with an InfoGAN extension. LS-GAN aims to generate high-quality images by minimizing the Pearson Ï‡2 divergence, and the InfoGAN extension allows for disentangled representation learning in an unsupervised manner.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* You have installed Python 3.x
* You have installed TensorFlow 1.x (The code may need updates for TensorFlow 2.x)
* You have a basic understanding of deep learning and GANs


## Usage

To use LS-GAN-TF, follow these steps:

```bash
python Info_LSGAN_Experiment.py
```

You can adjust hyperparameters within the script as needed.
